Hi,
Thank you for looking at my file locker/opener. This will put your files in a safe place where nobody can find them even you!

Instructions: 
1. Open the .bat and a folder call Locker will apper where ever you opened the .bat. Place any test file in there then run the program again and but "y"
2. To get the files back please open the file again and the password is "test" and your files will appear again.

NOTE:
It doesnt make them hidden that would be to easy.
